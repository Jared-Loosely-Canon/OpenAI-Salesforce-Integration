# Before You start

Note that this is open source, but can not be redistributed in proprietary software. Feel free to open pull requests to have additional features added

Next, understand that this app is 100% native so all communication between OpenAI and your salesforce org is owned between those two.
There is no intermediary.

However, you still must abide by any governance policies that your company employs.
